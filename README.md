# LLM System Prompts Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive technical and didactic guide analyzing leaked system prompts from major AI language models. The document reveals the internal architecture, operational logic, specific tools, and behavioral rules of models like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and others.

**Note: The main document is in Brazilian Portuguese. Feel free to translate it for your own use.**

## Content

The analysis covers:

1. **Internal Architecture and Operational Logic**: How each model is structured internally and what fundamental principles govern its operation.

2. **Specific Tools and Modules**: What specialized capabilities each model possesses and how they are implemented.

3. **Internal Behavioral Rules**: What guidelines and restrictions govern the model's responses and actions.

4. **Practical Interaction Recommendations**: How users and developers can optimize their interactions with each model.

## Models Analyzed

- Claude 3.7 (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT-4o and variants (OpenAI)
- Grok 3 (xAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Perplexity Voice Assistant
- OpenAI Deep Research
- And many others

## Comparative Analysis

The document includes structured comparative tables highlighting differences in:
- Architectural approaches
- Tools and capabilities
- Behavioral rules
- Interaction strategies

## Purpose

This analysis reveals not only the technical capabilities of these models but also the design philosophies, ethical concerns, and security approaches that their developers have incorporated. It provides valuable insights for researchers, developers, and users interested in understanding how these systems work beneath the surface.
